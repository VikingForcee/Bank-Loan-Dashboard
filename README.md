# Comprehensive Bank Loan Report Dashboard using MySQL & Tableau

I'm excited to share my latest project, where I utilized **MySQL** and **Tableau** to develop an in-depth **Bank Loan Report Dashboard**. This project is designed to deliver key insights into a bank's lending activities, enabling **data-driven decisions** and strategic planning.

## Project Overview
The objective was to create a **comprehensive report** that tracks and analyzes vital loan-related metrics, helping the bank monitor the health and performance of its loan portfolio. I focused on **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** critical for understanding lending operations.

## Key Features:
- **Jump Navigation Buttons**: Seamless toggling between the three dashboards.
- **Advanced Filters**: Applied filters that slice data across all dashboards, enhancing the depth of analysis.
- **Financial Insights**: A deeper understanding of bank loans and financial metrics.

## MySQL:
- Queried relevant data based on the problem statement.
- Generated and stored results, comparing them with the Tableau dashboards.

## Tableau Dashboards:
### Dashboard 1 (Summary):
- **KPIs**: Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Rate of Interest, and Average Debt to Income Ratio (DTI).
- **Visual Insights**: Added stats about Good Loans and Bad Loans using **Donut Charts**.

### Dashboard 2 (Overview):
- Utilized various charts (Line, Filled Map, Donut, Bar, Tree) to provide **granular insights**.

### Dashboard 3 (Details):
- Displayed all data with important fields, allowing for **detailed analysis** with filter options.

## Tools Used:
- **MySQL**: For querying and storing the data.
- **Tableau**: For visualizing the data and building interactive dashboards.
- **MS Excel**: Used during the data preprocessing phase.

## Learning Outcomes:
This project significantly enhanced my understanding of **MS Excel**, **MySQL**, **Tableau**, and **bank loan terminologies**. 

A special thanks to the **Data Tutorials YouTube Channel** for their guidance throughout this project.
